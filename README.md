# Root-Cause-Analysis-Models

[XMPro](https://xmpro.com/) has created a *Simplified Root Cause Analysis* Application to streamline the process of creating an RCA for different Asset Types.
The structure utilized for the RCA is based off the *Failure Mechanisms* and *Failure Causes* outlined in  [IEC 14424-2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/64076.html).
This general approach creates a standard structure that easily scales to multiple Asset Types.
